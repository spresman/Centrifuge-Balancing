# Centrifuge-Balancing

A 24-slot centrifuge is an essential tool in many modern laboratories used to separate mixtures via centrifugal force. 
A centrifuge can only be balanced when the weights of the samples are evenly distributed,
which gives rise to a simple algorithm that is implemented in this code. Applying the bc() function to a number will return a list of indices that would 
properly balance a 24-slot centrifuge.
